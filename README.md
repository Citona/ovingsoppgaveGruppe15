# Øvingsoppgave Gruppe 15

Lightweight repository used for a group exercise in Git collaboration and conflict resolution. Contributors add or update simple text/markdown files to practice branching and merging.

## Purpose
- Practice creating and resolving merge conflicts
- Experiment with branches, commits, and pull requests in a safe space

## Structure
- Assorted `.txt`/`.md` files contributed by team members
- `iLikeConflicts` – intentionally conflicting content for practice

## How to Contribute
1) Clone the repo and create a feature branch.
2) Add or edit a text/markdown file with your name or message.
3) Commit and push your changes, then open a pull request to simulate collaboration.

## License
No explicit license file is present. Treat the content as “all rights reserved” unless a license is added.
